# Paschen's Law 

This repository holds the MATLAB script which calculates the voltage breakdown given a pressure and distance. 

This is for the weird phenomena expressed in Paschen's Law when in low vacuum.

It was created due to an expierment gone wrong, when arcing occured on a payload board. 

This code now should be used before a vacuum test to ensure all systems clear and no breakdown will occur!
